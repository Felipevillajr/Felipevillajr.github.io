<p>During her life time Maya Angelou was very much beloved by many. She had many critics many of of which tried to ban her work, doing so successfully in FairFax, Virginia. Most notably she has been called the most banned author in the U.S. for her book I know Why the Caged Bird Sings due to concerns about her books containing references to child molestation, lesbianism, teen sex scenes and teen pregnancy. Regardless of these claims she was inducted during the 13th annual California hall of fame by First Partner, Governor of the State of California Jennifer Siebel Newsom and accepted by her son Guy Johnson. She has also recieved 3 grammys, the noble peace prize, the National Book Award, a Pulitzer Prize and an Emmy. She was also awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama in 2011. Her legacy continues to this day in the her works both written and in film. </p>
